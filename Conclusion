**Conclusion:

*   2D scatter plot suggests that ENc (Effective Number of Codons) values for some of the organism groups are less than zero. The ENc values are a measure of the codon usage bias in a gene or genome. A higher ENc value indicates a more biased codon usage, while a lower ENc value indicates a less biased codon usage.

      Some of the organism groups in the plot, such as Aves (birds) and Mammalia (mammals), have relatively high ENc values. This means that they have a strong preference for using certain codons over others. Other organism groups, such as Crustacea (crustaceans) and Molusca (mollusks), have lower ENc values. This means that they are less biased in their codon usage.

*   3D scatter plot shows that there is a general trend of increasing ENc with increasing GC3 content. This is because organisms with higher GC3 content tend to have a more uniform codon usage. However, there is also a significant amount of variation in ENc within each Organism Group. This is because other factors, such as natural selection and genetic drift, can also influence codon usage bias.

      Here are some specific observations from the plot:

      The Mammalia group has the highest average ENc, followed by the Aves group. This suggests that these groups have the most uniform codon usage.
      The Crustacea and Molusca groups have the lowest average ENc, suggesting that they have the most biased codon usage.
      There is a significant amount of overlap in ENc values between the different Organism Groups. This suggests that codon usage bias is not a unique feature of any particular taxonomic group.
